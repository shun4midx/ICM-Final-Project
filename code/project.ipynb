    " - `antimeme.png`: A vector-like, clean image with large flat color regions and strong contrast. This makes it easier to visually assess blur and to recover with regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `save_me.png`: A real-life photo with natural lighting, surface texture, sensor noise, and overlaid Chinese text plus artificial purple scribble. These factors introduce mixed frequencies and uneven illumination, making deconvolution and denoising more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `this_is_fine.png`: A comic drawing that is not vectorized and contains bold ink lines, but also visible grain and scan noise. It lies between the other two in difficulty: more complex than `antimeme.png` but cleaner than the real photo `save_me.png`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize the difficulty of restoring these images after encryption to be in this order: `save_me.png` > `this_is_fine.png` > `antimeme.png`"
