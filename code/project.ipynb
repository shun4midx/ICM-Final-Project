    "### Summary\n",
    "This project studies how image reconstruction behaves under different convolution-based transformations, including both standard (public) kernels and “encrypted” private-key kernels. We evaluate reconstruction accuracy when the correct kernel is known, and investigate the sensitivity of the inverse problem by testing recovery with intentionally incorrect kernels. We do not perform blind kernel estimation; all recovery assumes access to either the true kernel or a deliberately mismatched one.\n",

    "### 1. Preprocessing\n",
    "- Load each image (`antimeme`, `this_is_fine`, `save_me`) as an RGB array of size $512 \\times 512 \\times 3$.\n",
    "- Normalize pixel values to $[0,1]$.\n",
    "- No grayscale conversion is performed; convolution is applied independently to each R, G, B channel.\n",
