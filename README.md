## Project One Page Overview
![One Page Overview](https://github.com/shun4midx/Watermarked%20One%20Page%Overview)

## Requirements
The code was tested with:

- Python 3.9+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-image
```

## Instructions on How to Run This Code

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shun4midx/ICM-Final-Project
```

2. Go to the correct folder

```bash
cd code
cd src
```

3. Run!

```bash
python main.py
```

You should get all the corresponding outputs in `code/results`, with `images` containing all the raw outputted images, and `plots` for all the plots I used in my writeup.
